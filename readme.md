# Jumpy Bird AI
I wanted to experiment with my newfound knowledge in AI from various sources like [CodeBullet on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0e3QhIYukixgh5VVpKHH9Q)
and my Intro to Artificial Intelligence at RIT, and I asked myself, "what's the simplest, yet still interesting
project I can reasonably complete?" The result was an artificial intelligence that plays Flappy Bird- a game
with one output, whether or not to jump.

I decided to implement it with a neural network. After realizing that there is no "right answer" to the network,
I knew that the network needed to be trained somehow, and decided on a genetic algorithm. How many layers are
in the network, what inputs are used, learning rates, population size per generation, all of these attributes
are able to be modified before starting to see what AI training method gets to 1,000,000 points the fastest!
